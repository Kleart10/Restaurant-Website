Welcome to the Domenico Restaurant Website Project! This project is a comprehensive web application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, designed to showcase the offerings of Domenico Restaurant and provide a seamless user experience for visitors. Below is a detailed overview of the website's structure and features.

## Navigation Bar

The navigation bar is located in the header and contains buttons that allow users to navigate through different pages:
- **Home**
- **Menu**
- **Events**
- **Reservations**
- **Contacts**

## Homepage

The Homepage features:
- **Welcome Section**: An introduction to Domenico Restaurant.
- **About Section**: The history of the restaurant.
- **Gallery**: A slider showcasing images of the restaurant, implemented using JavaScript.

## Menu Page

The Menu page presents:
- **Complete Menu**: Displays all available dishes.
- **Filter Options**: Users can filter the menu to view prices and details of specific categories.

## Events Page

The Events page is organized into sections, each showcasing a different type of event offered by the restaurant. At the end of the page, there is a "Make a Reservation" button that redirects users to the Reservation page.

## Reservation Page

The Reservation page features:
